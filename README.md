# StylometryResearchOED <br />
Here lies the source for some research I performed on using Stylometry on the Old English Corpus <br />
It is not in a very readable state currently and hopefully will go through some revisions making it easier to understand and read <br />
For licensing reasons the Old English Corpus cannot be uploaded here, will provide a link to where we got a license at a later date <br />
This is also serves as a GUI that can be used for N-Gram analysis and other tests in the future <br />
