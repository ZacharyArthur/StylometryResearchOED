# StylometryResearchOED   
Here lies the source for some research I performed on using Stylometry on the Old English Corpus   
It is not in a very readable state currently and hopefully will go through some revisions making it easier to understand and read   
For licensing reasons the Old English Corpus cannot be uploaded here, will provide a link to where we got a license at a later date   
This is also serves as a GUI that can be used for N-Gram analysis and other tests in the future
